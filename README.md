## Hi there 👋

I am a Mechatronics Engineer, graduated from the University of Pamplona, Colombia, where I specialized in topics such as neural networks and computer vision. Additionally, I hold an ADSI Technologist degree from SENA. Professionally, I have experience as a backend developer, creating applications in monolithic architectures and API Rest, integrating with third parties (such as PayU, AWS-Route53, and DIAN). I also have experience in deploying and configuring Nginx servers with tools like Forge and Digital Ocean, knowledge in Docker containers, GitHub Actions, and testing. This has been mainly worked on with frameworks such as FastAPI, Laravel, and Express.

Although I enjoy backend development, my current focus is on using AI frameworks and/or libraries (such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, among others), which I implement alongside my backend knowledge to improve performance, accuracy, and add functionalities and/or features to the applications I develop, building scalable apps that allow the seamless integration and deployment of machine learning models.

I value teamwork and effective communication, and I am always willing to solve problems creatively and efficiently. I am motivated by continuous learning and overcoming technical challenges.

Connect with me to discuss ideas, projects, or collaboration opportunities!
